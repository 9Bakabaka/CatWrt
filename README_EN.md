## About

[i18n zh-cn ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.md)

**If you accidentally learned about this project, then you are very lucky. However, CatWrt is currently only open to custom OpenWrt projects for users in Mainland China. International users are not our primary audience. If you remove the Chinese language packages (i18n zh-cn) via opkg, it will basically become an English system. But our core content still revolves around the Blog.**

CatWrt is a redistribution of the Lean's LEDE based OpenWrt gateway project. If you need to get OpenWrt firmware in your country or region, it is recommended to use Tianling's [ImmortalWrt](https://github.com/immortalwrt/immortalwrt).
